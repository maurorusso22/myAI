    "Write a Python program to determine the solutions to the Eight Queens puzzle. The Eight Queens puzzle is a problem that involves finding a way to place eight queens (a chess piece) on an 8×8 chessboard in such a way that no queen can capture another using its standard movements. Therefore, a valid solution must ensure that no two queens share the same column, row, or diagonal."
