    "The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items, each with a given weight and value, to fit into a knapsack with a weight limit while optimizing a given objective. Two common variations of the problem include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Minimizing weight while ensuring a minimum total value\n",
    " - Maximizing value while staying within a given weight constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we use a Uniform Cost Search (UCS) approach to explore possible solutions while maintaining efficiency. The algorithm explores different states (item selections) while ensuring that constraints are met and the optimal solution is found."

    "    - The search prioritizes subsets that have higher value while ensuring the total weight does not exceed the constraint.\n",
